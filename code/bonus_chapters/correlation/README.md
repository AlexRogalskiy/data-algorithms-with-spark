# Correlation

Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which 
two or more variables fluctuate in relation to each other. A positive 
correlation indicates the extent to which those variables increase or 
decrease in parallel; a negative correlation indicates the extent to which 
one variable increases as the other decreases.

Possible values of the correlation coefficient range from `-1` to `+1`, 
with `-1` indicating a perfectly linear negative, i.e., inverse, correlation 
(sloping downward) and `+1` indicating a perfectly linear positive correlation 
(sloping upward). A correlation coefficient close to 0 suggests little, if any, 
correlation.
