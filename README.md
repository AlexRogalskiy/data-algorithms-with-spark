# Data Algorithms with Spark

* This new book (to be published by O'Reilly, ETA 2021) is the 2nd Edition of 
  [Data Algorithms](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-algorithms/9781491906170/) 
  (published by O'Reilly)
* The first edition used Java for Spark, but for the new book, I will use PySpark (much simpler and readable)
* The goal is to use Spark-3.0.0 (GA Edition)
